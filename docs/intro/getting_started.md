Welcome! This site repository contains common schemas related to permitting in the Natural Resources Sector for the
Province of British Columbia. The intent of these are to standardize the way permitting in the Natural Resource Sector
is described as data to enable quality and interoperability.

Hosting this specification in the open will encourage collaboration, adoption and enable versioning.

These will be reviewed and updated with relevant partners, data custodians, stewards and sector permitting teams.

## Purpose

Permitting is a complex space. B.C.'s Natural Resource Sector (NRS) alone has well over 600 permit types with just as
many ways to collect, process and store information from intake to decision. Analytics and reporting and permitting
reform is difficult for many reasons including data quality and inconsistencies with collection. Permitting systems
can't integrate without a common language.

This standard specifies the foundational set of core descriptive data types and elements required to enable the
compatibility and interoperability of Natural Resource permitting and authorization ecosystems, as well as define the
purpose and characteristics of permitting.  It will enable better business intelligence (ie. providing evidence for
policy shifts) and permitting process improvements while enabling flexibility to adapt to shifts in direction on
permitting.
