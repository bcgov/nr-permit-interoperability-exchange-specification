This page outlines the conceptual hierarchy and terminology embeddings which can describe the tracking of a process.

## Classifications

Refer to the [Process Tracking Terminology](/docs/intro/terminology#process-tracking) to understand the definitions
behind each classification level.

## Code Sets

Each classification within the context of a specific kind of lifecycle will have a codified and enumerated concept. TBD.

## Type Descriptors

Each kind of lifecycle may be described by a type descriptor. For example, an application may be an amendment type, or
it may be a transfer type. TBD
