An identifier for a specific area with clear boundaries.

## Overview

There a multiple ways to identify a parcel. Most common are the Parcel ID (PID) or Parcel Identification Number (PIN)

## Scope

This data type is intended to represent a unique identifier for a specific area with clear boundaries.

## Notes

- Parcel IDs are stored as numeric values from [ParcelMap BC](https://help.ltsa.ca/parcelmap-bc/parcelmap-bc-data-products-and-descriptions) (PMBC), however, due to their visual presentation many systems store the presentation which includes padded zeros and/or dashes.
- The BC Data Service distributes PMBC data on behalf of the provincial government (see [BC Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/group/47fa4daf-78d1-4c64-a0d2-51638a04910d)) and makes the Parcel IDs available in these different formats.

## Constraints

- This data type shall describe the physical address and not the mailing address. (Ref: [Address Data Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/address_data_standards_-_mailing_delivery_residential.pdf))

## Structure

| Name | Cardinality | Type | Description & Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| legal_description | 1..1 | `string` | The full legal description of the parcel and is primarily recorded from the Land Title Register. Where recorded only in the Crown Land Registry, this attribute is to be populated from Tantalis for the fabric compilation, but maintained by PMBC during on-going operations. |
| crown_land_registry_id | 0..1 | `integer` | Parcel ID is the Land Title Register parcel identifier, a nine-digit number that uniquely identifies a parcel in the land title register of in British Columbia. The registrar assigns PID numbers to parcels for which a title is being entered as a registered title. The Land Title Act refers to the PID as the permanent parcel identifier. |
| land_title_register_id | 0..1 | `integer` | The parcel identification number (PIN) is the Crown Land Registry Parcel Identifier. |
| parcel_name | 0..1 | `string` | The same as the PID, if there is one. If there is a PIN but no PID, then parcel name is the PIN. If there is no PID nor PIN, then it is the parcel class value, e.g., COMMON OWNERSHIP, BUILDING STRATA, AIR SPACE, ROAD, PARK. |
